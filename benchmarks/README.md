# c15t Benchmarks

This directory contains the internal benchmark platform for `c15t`, `@c15t/react`, and `@c15t/nextjs`.

## Performance Suites

- `core-benchmarks`
  Measures framework-agnostic runtime work such as store creation, `has()`, cookie round-trips, init, repeat-visitor init, and script updates.
- `bundle-test-app`
  Builds a dedicated Next app and records route-level client script size plus publish tarball sizes for `c15t`, `@c15t/react`, and `@c15t/nextjs`.
- `react-browser-bench`
  Runs Playwright against a React-flavoured benchmark app with local deterministic API routes.
- `nextjs-browser-bench`
  Runs Playwright against a Next integration benchmark app covering client, prefetch, SSR, and repeat-visitor paths.
- `script-lifecycle-bench`
  Runs deterministic local script lifecycle flows for load, unload, reload, callback-only, `alwaysLoad`, and `persistAfterConsentRevoked` behavior.
- `shared`
  Shared schema, fixtures, budgets, comparison logic, and report formatting.

## Compatibility Suites

- `css-layer-preview`
  Manual review shell for the shared CSS matrix.
- `tw3-test`
  Tailwind 3 compatibility harness.
- `tw4-test`
  Tailwind 4 compatibility harness.
- `no-tw-test`
  Plain CSS compatibility harness.

## Outputs

Benchmark tasks write machine-readable JSON to:

- `.benchmarks/current/**`
- `.benchmarks/head/**`
- `.benchmarks/nightly/**`
- `.benchmarks/compare/**`

`bun run bench:compare` compares base vs head artifacts and emits:

- `.benchmarks/compare/comparison.json`
- `.benchmarks/compare/comparison.md`

`.benchmarks/` is gitignored so local and CI benchmark artifacts do not dirty the worktree.

## Important React v2/v3 Benchmarks

See [`V3.md`](./V3.md) for the current React v3 benchmark notes, reference results, and interpretation.

Use the combined React benchmark runner when comparing the important v2 and v3 browser paths during the React v3 migration:

```bash
bun run bench:important-react -- --iterations 10
```

This runs the following benchmark suites in parallel:

- `react-browser-bench` via `bench:banner-visibility`
  Measures how long it takes for the consent banner to become ready and visible after navigation.
- `script-lifecycle-bench` via `bench:script-count`
  Measures script loading after accepting consent for the configured script counts.

Useful flags:

```bash
bun run bench:important-react -- -i 10 --warmup 1 --script-counts 5,10,25,50
```

- `-i, --iterations <n>` sets measured samples per metric.
- `--warmup <n>` sets warmup samples before measurement.
- `--script-counts <list>` sets the script-count cases for the script loading benchmark.

The combined runner prefixes child process output with `[banner]` and `[scripts]`, exits nonzero if either benchmark fails, and writes the same JSON artifacts as the individual package scripts:

- `.benchmarks/current/banner-visibility/react-v2-v3-banner-visibility.json`
- `.benchmarks/current/script-count/react-v2-v3-script-count.json`

Run the individual suites directly when iterating on one benchmark:

```bash
cd benchmarks/react-browser-bench
BENCH_ITERATIONS=10 bun run bench:banner-visibility

cd ../script-lifecycle-bench
BENCH_ITERATIONS=10 SCRIPT_COUNTS=5,10,25,50 bun run bench:script-count
```

Bundle size is measured separately by `bundle-test-app` because it is build analysis rather than an iteration-based browser runtime benchmark.

## Fixture Model

Shared fixtures live in `shared/src/fixtures.ts`.

- `tiny`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `xlarge` scale translation payload, script volume, and UI complexity.
- c15t currently exposes five built-in consent categories, so larger fixtures scale primarily via translation/script complexity rather than additional category names.
- `core-benchmarks` measures script-manager reconciliation speed only. It does not measure remote third-party script latency.
- Browser startup benches expose app-startup script waterfall metrics, not CDN speed for third-party scripts.
- `script-lifecycle-bench` is the source of truth for actual load/unload/reload consent flow timings.

## Still Unbenchmarked

The current platform still leaves a few areas intentionally out of scope:

- IAB-gated script lifecycle scenarios
- Remote CDN latency and real third-party network variance
- Memory and retained-heap behavior after repeated mount/unmount cycles
- Artifact file-count and brotli-size reporting
- Per-framework script lifecycle hosts for Vue, Svelte, and Solid

## Framework Adapter Contract

Future framework benchmark apps should follow the same shape as the React and Next apps.

Each framework benchmark app should provide:

- routes or pages for `headless`, `full-ui`, `repeat-visitor`, and `vanilla-core`
- `client`, `ssr`, and `prefetch` routes where the framework supports them
- a browser-exposed benchmark object with normalized timing and lifecycle fields
- local deterministic init/subject endpoints or equivalent local fixtures
- mount/render/update probes suitable for that framework runtime

Normalized benchmark state should include:

- `scenario`
- `bannerReadyMs`
- `bannerVisibleMs`
- `mountCount`
- `renderCount` or equivalent reactive update count
- interaction timings
- request counts
- error count if the framework-specific harness exposes it

## CI

- `benchmark-regression.yml`
  Runs on performance-sensitive PRs and on pushes to `main` and `canary`.
- `benchmark-comment.yml`
  Posts a sticky PR comment from regression artifacts.

The current rollout is report-first. Hard failures can be enabled by setting the repository variable `C15T_BENCHMARK_ENFORCE=true`.

Bundle benchmarks protect route-level client JavaScript size. Artifact benchmarks protect publish-size growth for the shipped packages.
IAB-gated script lifecycle coverage is intentionally not included in v1 of the script lifecycle suite.
