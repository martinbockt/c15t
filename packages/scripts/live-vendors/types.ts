 *   response, rather than the 2xx JavaScript body the full tier demands. Use
 *   this for vendors whose loader rejects placeholder account ids (for example
 *   with a 404) so the probe still proves bootstrap and consent gating against
 *   the real endpoint. Runtime is still asserted whenever the vendor declares
 *   `runtimeCheck` or `runtimeReplacedGlobals` — some loaders serve a usable
 *   runtime even for unknown ids, and skipping those assertions would leave
 *   the vendor with no coverage of the SDK actually starting.
 * - `skip`: the vendor cannot be probed live (for example edge-injected
 *   scripts). Skipped vendors are reported with `skipReason` so coverage gaps
 *   stay visible instead of silently disappearing.
