# @c15t/node-sdk

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Restore `enabled: false` so all client-side consents are granted, initialization requests are skipped, and consent-gated scripts load immediately.

  Fix `www` handling in CORS origin matching. `*.example.com` now accepts `https://www.example.com`, and a schemeless `www.example.com` entry accepts both the apex and `www` forms.

  Support native WebView app schemes in `trustedOrigins` (`capacitor://localhost`, `ionic://localhost`, custom `iosScheme` values), matched on both scheme and host.

  Declare `hono` as `^4.12.34` rather than an exact pin so you can take Hono security releases without waiting for a new `@c15t/backend`.

## 2.2.0-canary-20260727202135

### Patch Changes

- 16a1f82: Dependency audit for the next release: remove unused `@orpc/*` dependencies from `@c15t/backend` and `@c15t/node-sdk`, update runtime dependencies (hono 4.12.27, valibot 1.4.2, defu 6.1.7, jose 6.2.3, zod 4.4.3, zustand 5.0.14, xstate 5.32.4, and more), and force security floors for kysely (SQL injection fixes) and protobufjs via workspace overrides. Builds now use TypeScript 7 (native compiler) with rslib 0.23 for type checking and declaration emit; emitted types are semantically unchanged.
- c7e53ff: Forward `x-c15t-version` on backend-bound requests from browser, SSR, prefetch, and Node SDK clients, and allow the header through backend CORS preflight handling.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a89092: Expanded the script loader with a registry-backed provider system and a much
  broader set of consent-aware integrations. New helpers cover analytics,
  advertising pixels, functional tools, and tag managers, including Ahrefs,
  Cloudflare Web Analytics, Fathom, Hotjar, Matomo, Microsoft Clarity, Mixpanel,
  Plausible, PromptWatch, Rybbit, Segment, Umami, Vercel Analytics, Reddit Pixel,
  Snapchat Pixel, and Crisp/Intercom.

  Provider manifests now share common utilities for script URL resolution, boolean
  data attributes, install-step builders, Google consent mapping, and lifecycle
  execution. The package also includes registry metadata, focused provider tests,
  and engine coverage so script helpers resolve predictable loader URLs,
  attributes, consent callbacks, and queued vendor calls.

  Google Tag and Google Tag Manager boot timestamps now resolve during script
  lifecycle execution instead of helper construction, which keeps documented setup
  patterns compatible with Next.js Cache Components prerendering.

  PostHog now supports explicit EU/US region selection, keeps the bootstrap script
  host aligned with an explicit API host, and exposes loading modes for immediate
  cookieless consent sync, consent-gated loading, or disabling the helper without
  issuing a PostHog network request.

  Updated the docs and CLI generation prompts so these providers are discoverable
  from the integration docs and script-loader setup flows.

## 2.0.0-rc.8

### Patch Changes

- 918a70e: Fix published TypeScript declaration packaging so consumers stay compatible across both TypeScript 5 and TypeScript 6.

  - `@c15t/react`: correct the `./primitives` type export entries so they point at the published `dist-types` files instead of missing declaration paths.
  - `@c15t/backend`, `@c15t/cli`, `@c15t/dev-tools`, `@c15t/logger`, `@c15t/node-sdk`, and `@c15t/scripts`: normalize emitted `dist-types` imports during builds so published declarations no longer reference sibling `.d.ts` files directly, which could break consumers on newer TypeScript versions.
  - Tooling: make declaration normalization discover package targets dynamically so the compatibility fix applies consistently across published packages instead of only a hardcoded subset.

### Patch Changes

- e79f840: Separate published declaration files from runtime bundles to improve Vite compatibility

  - Move generated `.d.ts` files out of `dist/` into `dist-types/` across published packages
  - Stop emitting declaration maps in shared TypeScript config so `.d.ts.map` files are no longer published
  - Emit declarations only once per package to avoid unstable output when both `esm` and `cjs` builds write types
  - Update package `types` metadata, publish file lists, Turbo outputs, and publish artifact checks for the new layout
  - Verify the package layout works in Vite 7 without `optimizeDeps.exclude` workarounds for `c15t` and `@c15t/react`
