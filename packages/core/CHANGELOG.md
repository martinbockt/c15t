# c15t

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Restore `enabled: false` so all client-side consents are granted, initialization requests are skipped, and consent-gated scripts load immediately.

  Fix `www` handling in CORS origin matching. `*.example.com` now accepts `https://www.example.com`, and a schemeless `www.example.com` entry accepts both the apex and `www` forms.

  Support native WebView app schemes in `trustedOrigins` (`capacitor://localhost`, `ionic://localhost`, custom `iosScheme` values), matched on both scheme and host.

  Declare `hono` as `^4.12.34` rather than an exact pin so you can take Hono security releases without waiting for a new `@c15t/backend`.

## 2.2.0-canary-20260731105620

### Patch Changes

- c187c9d: Add a `nonce` option for nonce-based Content Security Policies

  The injected `<style id="c15t-theme">` element previously carried no nonce, so a strict CSP blocked it unless you allowed `'unsafe-inline'`. Setting `nonce` on the provider options now applies it to that stylesheet and to every `<script>` element created by the script loader. A per-script `nonce` still takes precedence.

  ```tsx
  <ConsentManagerProvider options={{ mode: "offline", nonce }}>
    {children}
  </ConsentManagerProvider>
  ```

## 2.2.0-canary-20260727202135

### Patch Changes

- 16a1f82: Dependency audit for the next release: remove unused `@orpc/*` dependencies from `@c15t/backend` and `@c15t/node-sdk`, update runtime dependencies (hono 4.12.27, valibot 1.4.2, defu 6.1.7, jose 6.2.3, zod 4.4.3, zustand 5.0.14, xstate 5.32.4, and more), and force security floors for kysely (SQL injection fixes) and protobufjs via workspace overrides. Builds now use TypeScript 7 (native compiler) with rslib 0.23 for type checking and declaration emit; emitted types are semantically unchanged.
- ace6760: Fix IAB TCF in offline mode and on override-driven re-initialization:

  - The `iab()` factory now injects `fetchGVL` into the runtime module, so offline mode (and the hosted fallback path) can load the Global Vendor List. Previously the GVL never loaded and the IAB banner silently never rendered in offline mode.
  - The GVL is requested with the resolved language (`Accept-Language`), so purpose and feature names match the rest of the consent UI.
  - `setOverrides`/`setLanguage` now pass the IAB config through re-initialization, so a language or location change refreshes the GVL instead of keeping a stale one.

- c7e53ff: Forward `x-c15t-version` on backend-bound requests from browser, SSR, prefetch, and Node SDK clients, and allow the header through backend CORS preflight handling.
- ace6760: `getOrCreateConsentRuntime` (the shared runtime behind `ConsentManagerProvider`) now forwards the `headers` option to hosted clients instead of silently dropping it, and includes the headers in the runtime cache key so clients with different headers never share a cached instance.
- e4315bd: Script loader: forward an explicit `async: false` to the injected script element. Dynamically injected scripts are async by default, so vendor helpers documenting synchronous loading (for example legacy Adobe Tags embeds) previously had no effect.
- 5406a8d: Match legal-document policy types (`privacy_policy`, `dpa`, `terms_and_conditions`) by prefix so suffixed variants like `terms_and_conditions_b2b` are accepted, letting multiple policies of one family be active at once. Unknown types are still rejected.
- ca7784f: Prevent duplicate consent records from concurrent identical submissions. Concurrent in-flight client saves with the same intent are coalesced, and backend submissions derive the consent primary key from tenant, subject, domain, policy, and `givenAt`, so identical requests collide on the key every deployed database already enforces. Scope legacy duplicate lookups to the current tenant, and reject timestamps outside JavaScript's representable `Date` range before deriving the ID.
- 30cb116: Clamp client consent `givenAt` timestamps more than five minutes ahead of the server clock to server time before deriving consent validity. Preserve the client's original claim as `metadata.clientGivenAt` and use that claim for consent identity so retries remain idempotent. Sync local consent state to the timestamp recorded by the server. Leave timestamps within the five-minute tolerance and past timestamps unchanged.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a89092: Expanded the script loader with a registry-backed provider system and a much
  broader set of consent-aware integrations. New helpers cover analytics,
  advertising pixels, functional tools, and tag managers, including Ahrefs,
  Cloudflare Web Analytics, Fathom, Hotjar, Matomo, Microsoft Clarity, Mixpanel,
  Plausible, PromptWatch, Rybbit, Segment, Umami, Vercel Analytics, Reddit Pixel,
  Snapchat Pixel, and Crisp/Intercom.

  Provider manifests now share common utilities for script URL resolution, boolean
  data attributes, install-step builders, Google consent mapping, and lifecycle
  execution. The package also includes registry metadata, focused provider tests,
  and engine coverage so script helpers resolve predictable loader URLs,
  attributes, consent callbacks, and queued vendor calls.

  Google Tag and Google Tag Manager boot timestamps now resolve during script
  lifecycle execution instead of helper construction, which keeps documented setup
  patterns compatible with Next.js Cache Components prerendering.

  PostHog now supports explicit EU/US region selection, keeps the bootstrap script
  host aligned with an explicit API host, and exposes loading modes for immediate
  cookieless consent sync, consent-gated loading, or disabling the helper without
  issuing a PostHog network request.

  Updated the docs and CLI generation prompts so these providers are discoverable
  from the integration docs and script-loader setup flows.

## 2.0.0-rc.10

### Patch Changes

- 9579b62: Add token-first legal-document consent groundwork for `2.0`.

  - `c15t`: expand the unstable policy-consent input types so legal-document writes can prefer `documentSnapshotToken`, fall back to `policyHash`, and keep `policyId` only as a compatibility path.
  - `@c15t/backend`: update legal-document consent writes to resolve append-only consent against a verified document snapshot token when configured, or against a provided document hash when only lighter-weight release proof is available.
  - `@c15t/schema`: extend the subject consent schema and error shapes for legal-document snapshot tokens and hash-based legal-document resolution.

- Updated dependencies [9579b62]
  - @c15t/schema@2.0.0-rc.6

## 2.0.0-rc.8

### Minor Changes

- 3d4c107: feat(consent): add change-only consent callbacks

  - add `onConsentChanged` as a dedicated callback for explicit consent saves that change an existing persisted consent state
  - include both previous and current consent categories in the callback payload so analytics and integrations can diff grant/revoke transitions directly
  - keep `onConsentSet` focused on broad consent-state updates, including initialization and auto-grant flows
  - update the React provider to keep callback registrations in sync when callback props change after mount

- c944e35: feat(core): move policy action resolution from @c15t/react to c15t core

  Policy-driven action resolution utilities (`resolvePolicyAllowedActions`, `resolvePolicyActionGroups`, `resolvePolicyPrimaryActions`, etc.) are now exported from `c15t` core for shared consent surface runtimes.

  feat(scripts): move bundled integrations to declarative, schema-versioned `VendorManifest` definitions compiled through `resolveManifest()`. The manifest runtime now supports structured startup and consent phases, complex consent conditions, compile caching, and Google Consent Mode v2 signaling without helper-authored lifecycle overrides.

  feat(dev-tools): add script lifecycle and manifest runtime telemetry to the events and scripts panels, including grouped activity traces for `onBeforeLoad`, `onLoad`, and `onConsentChange`.

### Patch Changes

- 43f1b68: - fix `identifyUser()` to consistently use the consent `subjectId` for `PATCH /subjects/:id`, keep the legacy `id` alias backward compatible, and tighten request typing plus retry handling for malformed pending identify submissions.
- 5956531: Simplify the 2.0 static prefetch flow so static routes only need to start `/init` early and matching prefetched data is consumed automatically during first store initialization.

  - `c15t`: add canonical request-context metadata for SSR and browser-prefetch payloads, auto-consume matching prefetched data on first runtime/store initialization, and replace blanket SSR skip-on-overrides behavior with exact request-context matching.
  - `@c15t/react`: preserve the dynamic SSR `fetchInitialData()` flow while exposing the new `context_mismatch` SSR status behavior for matching overrides, backend URLs, credentials, and ambient GPC.
  - `@c15t/nextjs`: remove the RC-era public static-prefetch consumer APIs from the package surface and document `C15tPrefetch` as the only static-route setup step.
  - `@c15t/cli`: update generated static-route templates to rely on automatic prefetch consumption instead of wiring manual prefetch lookups.

## 2.0.0-rc.6

### Minor Changes

- e08e52c: feat: Extract IAB TCF to `@c15t/iab` addon package

  IAB TCF 2.3 support is now an opt-in addon. Non-IAB users no longer pay for IAB code in their bundle.

  **Breaking changes:**

  - `IABConsentBanner`, `IABConsentDialog`, and `useHeadlessIABConsentUI` are no longer exported from `@c15t/react`. Import from `@c15t/react/iab` instead.
  - IAB config now requires the `iab()` wrapper from `@c15t/iab` instead of a plain `{ enabled: true, ... }` object.

  **Migration:**

  ```tsx
  // Before
  import { IABConsentBanner, IABConsentDialog } from '@c15t/react';
  <ConsentManagerProvider options={{ iab: { enabled: true, cmpId: 28 } }}>

  // After
  import { iab } from '@c15t/iab';
  import { IABConsentBanner, IABConsentDialog } from '@c15t/react/iab';
  <ConsentManagerProvider options={{ iab: iab({ cmpId: 28 }) }}>
  ```

  **Bundle impact for non-IAB users:**

  - Core bundle: -3.0 KB gzip (-9.2%)
  - Lazy chunks eliminated: -9.9 KB gzip
  - Total: -12.9 KB gzip (-30%)
  - `@iabtechlabtcf/core` removed from core dependencies

### Patch Changes

- bb3ab0f: chore: update dependencies, including zustand and typescript
- 1a724fc: fix(policy-packs): support multiple primary actions while keeping customize as the default primary action

  Expose `primaryActions` consistently across schema, backend, core, React, and dev-tools. Built-in preset and offline default policies keep `customize` as the default primary action, while custom policies can now mark multiple actions as primary.

- Updated dependencies [1a724fc]
  - @c15t/schema@2.0.0-rc.4

## 2.0.0-rc.5

### Minor Changes

- 372cf92: feat(policy): add policy packs for declarative regional consent resolution

  Policy packs let you define regional consent rules once — c15t resolves the right policy automatically based on visitor location. Resolution follows fixed priority: region → country → fallback → default.

  - Built-in presets: `europeOptIn()`, `europeIab()`, `californiaOptOut()`, `californiaOptIn()`, `quebecOptIn()`, `worldNoBanner()`
  - Per-policy GPC support via `consent.gpc` field
  - Fallback policies (`match.fallback`) as a safety net when geo-location headers are missing
  - Material policy fingerprints for automatic re-prompting when consent semantics change
  - Policy validation with `inspectPolicies()` for catching misconfigurations before deployment
  - Snapshot tokens (signed JWT) for write-time consistency between `/init` and consent writes
  - Dev-tools match trace panel showing full resolution path

### Patch Changes

- 021ac99: Bundle version-matched docs inside published c15t packages under `docs/**` for local agent and developer reference.

  Remove CLI `AGENTS.md` generation. Use the bundled package docs directly alongside c15t agent skills.

- 5f30a3b: Add browser prefetch utilities for faster consent banner visibility

  - New `buildPrefetchScript()` and `getPrefetchedInitialData()` in `c15t` core to start the `/init` request before framework hydration
  - New `C15tPrefetch` component in `@c15t/nextjs` using `next/script` with `beforeInteractive` strategy for static-route-compatible prefetching
  - Tuned default motion tokens (fast: 80ms, normal: 150ms, slow: 200ms) and replaced hardcoded CSS durations with theme variables

- 58fb392: Rename translation-facing APIs from `translations` to `i18n` across runtime types and helpers.
  Add CLI migration codemods to update existing projects to the new naming.
- e79f840: Separate published declaration files from runtime bundles to improve Vite compatibility

  - Move generated `.d.ts` files out of `dist/` into `dist-types/` across published packages
  - Stop emitting declaration maps in shared TypeScript config so `.d.ts.map` files are no longer published
  - Emit declarations only once per package to avoid unstable output when both `esm` and `cjs` builds write types
  - Update package `types` metadata, publish file lists, Turbo outputs, and publish artifact checks for the new layout
  - Verify the package layout works in Vite 7 without `optimizeDeps.exclude` workarounds for `c15t` and `@c15t/react`

- 58fb392: Rename `c15t` mode references to `hosted` in core runtime and CLI generate flows.
  Add migration codemods and template updates for the hosted vs offline terminology.
