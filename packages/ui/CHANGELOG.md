## 2.2.0-canary-20260731105620

### Patch Changes

- c187c9d: Add a `nonce` option for nonce-based Content Security Policies

  The injected `<style id="c15t-theme">` element previously carried no nonce, so a strict CSP blocked it unless you allowed `'unsafe-inline'`. Setting `nonce` on the provider options now applies it to that stylesheet and to every `<script>` element created by the script loader. A per-script `nonce` still takes precedence.

  ```tsx
  <ConsentManagerProvider options={{ mode: "offline", nonce }}>
    {children}
  </ConsentManagerProvider>
  ```

## 2.2.0-canary-20260727202135

### Minor Changes

- ace6760: Add a policy-aware `consentActions.primary` theme key. It styles whichever action(s) the active policy marks as primary (`ui.banner.primaryActions`), so the policy decides which action is primary while the theme decides how a primary action looks. Resolution order: explicit props → per-action keys (`accept`/`reject`/`customize`) → `primary` → `default` → fallback.

  The IAB consent banner previously hardcoded its button variants, bypassing `consentActions`; it now resolves button treatments through the same logic, keeping its stock styling as the fallback.

### Patch Changes

- b032a69: Add `ConsentDialogTriggerToolbar` to React and Next.js as an opt-in, draggable toolbar with app-owned actions and exactly one built-in consent preferences action. The existing `ConsentDialogTrigger` remains unchanged.
- 16a1f82: Dependency audit for the next release: remove unused `@orpc/*` dependencies from `@c15t/backend` and `@c15t/node-sdk`, update runtime dependencies (hono 4.12.27, valibot 1.4.2, defu 6.1.7, jose 6.2.3, zod 4.4.3, zustand 5.0.14, xstate 5.32.4, and more), and force security floors for kysely (SQL injection fixes) and protobufjs via workspace overrides. Builds now use TypeScript 7 (native compiler) with rslib 0.23 for type checking and declaration emit; emitted types are semantically unchanged.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a89092: Expanded the script loader with a registry-backed provider system and a much
  broader set of consent-aware integrations. New helpers cover analytics,
  advertising pixels, functional tools, and tag managers, including Ahrefs,
  Cloudflare Web Analytics, Fathom, Hotjar, Matomo, Microsoft Clarity, Mixpanel,
  Plausible, PromptWatch, Rybbit, Segment, Umami, Vercel Analytics, Reddit Pixel,
  Snapchat Pixel, and Crisp/Intercom.

  Provider manifests now share common utilities for script URL resolution, boolean
  data attributes, install-step builders, Google consent mapping, and lifecycle
  execution. The package also includes registry metadata, focused provider tests,
  and engine coverage so script helpers resolve predictable loader URLs,
  attributes, consent callbacks, and queued vendor calls.

  Google Tag and Google Tag Manager boot timestamps now resolve during script
  lifecycle execution instead of helper construction, which keeps documented setup
  patterns compatible with Next.js Cache Components prerendering.

  PostHog now supports explicit EU/US region selection, keeps the bootstrap script
  host aligned with an explicit API host, and exposes loading modes for immediate
  cookieless consent sync, consent-gated loading, or disabling the helper without
  issuing a PostHog network request.

  Updated the docs and CLI generation prompts so these providers are discoverable
  from the integration docs and script-loader setup flows.

### Patch Changes

- 10cec50: Fix consent widget footer slot styling so container classes no longer leak onto nested footer subgroups.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 50e17f0: Fix Tailwind CSS v3 stylesheet packaging so package resolvers that do not follow nested CSS imports still include the generated c15t component rules.

  Root `styles.tw3.css` and `iab/styles.tw3.css` proxy entrypoints are now published, and the React/Next.js Tailwind v3 dist stylesheets inline the generated UI CSS instead of forwarding through nested package imports.

  - c15t@2.0.0
  - @c15t/translations@2.0.0

## 2.0.0-rc.11

### Patch Changes

- aa2bb42: Fix consent switch sizing so it renders consistently in Tailwind and non-Tailwind apps.

  - `@c15t/ui`: make the shared switch primitive use an explicit `border-box` layout, size its track independently of host box-model resets, and clip the track so the thumb ring does not bleed past the edge.
  - `@c15t/react`: publish the updated prebuilt consent UI styling so React consumers pick up the normalized switch sizing.
  - `@c15t/nextjs`: publish the updated stylesheet bridge so Next.js installs pick up the normalized switch sizing as well.

## 2.0.0-rc.10

### Minor Changes

- 79ae8cf: Remove the legacy stock-branding theme keys and require the new explicit tag slots for prebuilt consent surfaces.

  - `@c15t/react`: stop resolving stock banner/dialog/widget/IAB branding tags through legacy footer-branding aliases and render the standalone widget/dialog tags without the old footer-wrapper compatibility path.
  - `@c15t/ui`: add explicit branding tag slots for each prebuilt surface: `consentBannerTag`, `consentDialogTag`, `consentWidgetTag`, `iabConsentBannerTag`, and `iabConsentDialogTag`.

  Breaking change:

  - `consentWidgetBranding` has been removed. Use `consentWidgetTag`.
  - `consentDialogFooter` no longer styles the stock dialog branding tag. Use `consentDialogTag`.
  - Style stock banner and IAB branding tags via the new explicit tag slots instead of footer-related keys.

### Patch Changes

- 64d6009: Replace the shared `clsx` dependency with a local `cn` implementation owned by `@c15t/ui`.

  - `@c15t/ui`: own the public `ClassValue` type and `cn(...)` implementation directly instead of re-exporting them from `clsx`, with coverage for nested arrays, object maps, numeric values, and ordering.
  - `@c15t/react`: continue consuming the shared `@c15t/ui` class helper while dropping the now-unused direct `clsx` dependency from the published package.
  - `@c15t/dev-tools`: remove the unused direct `clsx` dependency from the published package manifest.

- 7576dc1: Derive `textOnPrimary` automatically from the active `primary` theme color when it is omitted, so primary-filled surfaces such as stock branding tags keep a readable foreground by default.

  - add a shared contrast helper in the UI theme utilities and use it as the fallback for `textOnPrimary`
  - preserve explicit `textOnPrimary` overrides for consumers who need a fixed branded foreground

  - c15t@2.0.0-rc.10

## 2.0.0-rc.9

### Patch Changes

- 59b850b: Harden the prebuilt consent-surface branding against host-page CSS so the INTH and c15t wordmarks stay correctly sized across docs, marketing sites, and other embedded app shells.

  - `@c15t/react`: wrap both prebuilt full-logo branding paths in shared internal wordmark containers instead of attaching sizing classes directly to the raw `svg` elements.
  - `@c15t/ui`: move the logo constraints onto the internal branding wrappers and nested `svg` elements, adding explicit flex, max-width, block-layout, and aspect-ratio rules so global host-page `svg` styles cannot blow up or collapse either wordmark.
  - `@c15t/nextjs`: keep the published styled surface behavior aligned with the hardened React/UI branding path used by the prebuilt consent banner and dialog components.

## 2.0.0-rc.8

### Patch Changes

- cd9c830: Fix the `PolicyActions` DX regressions and the published stylesheet packaging for the prebuilt consent UI.

  - `@c15t/ui`: deduplicate policy-action helper ownership behind `c15t`, normalize widget footer subgroup naming, and add direct coverage for action-group flattening.
  - `@c15t/react`: share the internal `PolicyActions` renderer across banner and widget, add `consentAction` to policy-action render props so stock overrides preserve built-in theming, restore the banner default footer layout when policy hints do not provide a layout, and extend regression coverage.
  - `@c15t/nextjs`: keep the published stylesheet bridge files aligned with the package entrypoints and publish-artifact guard.

- fee82fd: Refine prebuilt consent-surface branding so it feels attached to the UI instead of appended.

  - `@c15t/react`: add attached branding tags to the stock consent banner, consent dialog, IAB banner, and IAB dialog; localize the branding copy through translations; and add a `hideBranding` prop to the stock `ConsentBanner` component.
  - `@c15t/nextjs`: keep the published stylesheet entrypoints aligned with the updated prebuilt branding treatment while simplifying stylesheet distribution to reference upstream package styles directly.
  - `@c15t/ui`: update the shared consent branding tag styles for tighter edge attachment, smaller visual footprint, and consistent banner/dialog treatment across standard and IAB surfaces.
  - `@c15t/translations`: add the shared localized branding copy used by the updated prebuilt consent surfaces.

## 2.0.0-rc.7

### Minor Changes

- ec30bd1: feat(primitives): shared UI primitive runtime, framework adapters, and runtime performance

  - Extract seven framework-agnostic primitives into `@c15t/ui/primitives`: accordion, button, collapsible, dialog, switch, tabs, and preference-item
  - Add `PreferenceItem` compound component that unifies three separate expandable-row patterns (Radix Accordion, custom button + AnimatedCollapse, manual state) into a single composable primitive with semantic slots
  - Publish framework adapter packages (`@c15t/solid`, `@c15t/vue`, `@c15t/svelte`) re-exporting shared primitives and CSS variant generators
  - Add cross-framework storybooks with shared play-function interaction tests and CI test-runner integration

  **Mobile viewport fixes:**

  - Add `box-sizing: border-box` to all fixed-position consent roots (banner, dialog, IAB variants) — prevents horizontal overflow on narrow viewports
  - Constrain dialog card with `max-height: 100%` and scrollable content area — prevents title/description from being pushed off-screen on small devices

  **Runtime performance (react-browser-bench, full-ui scenario):**

  - Memoize `useTheme()` deep merge with `useMemo` — reduces calls from 35 to 23 (-35%), total time from 0.10 ms to 0.02 ms (-80%)
  - Replace `offsetWidth`/`offsetHeight` visibility checks in focus trap with `checkVisibility()` API — eliminates forced synchronous layout on every Tab keypress
  - Both optimizations are in `@c15t/ui` and benefit all frameworks equally

## 2.0.0-rc.6

### Patch Changes

- 5c8ee05: feat(styles): ship explicit stylesheet entrypoints for prebuilt UI

  - Publish explicit `styles.css` and `iab/styles.css` entrypoints for prebuilt UI in `@c15t/ui`, `@c15t/react`, and `@c15t/nextjs`
  - Update docs and CLI setup so stylesheet imports and Tailwind host-app configuration are explicit
  - Support the documented Tailwind 3 and Tailwind 4 layering model without requiring `!important`
  - Add automated first-paint CDP benchmark (`benchmarks/vite-react-repro/scripts/run-first-paint-bench.ts`)

  **Bundle impact (vite-react-repro):**

  - JS: 435.5 KB → 361.0 KB (-74.5 KB raw, -13.4 KB gzip / -11%)
  - CSS: 0.8 KB → 49.2 KB (moved from JS to CSS — net gzip saving: -6.5 KB / -5%)
  - `createElement("style")` runtime calls: eliminated
  - JS heap: -143 KB (-8%)

  **Main-thread impact (6x CPU throttle, 3 runs × 60 samples):**

  - JS evaluation: 64.5 ms → 53.1 ms (-11.4 ms / -17.7%)
  - Total → first paint: 87.8 ms → 76.5 ms (-11.3 ms / -12.9%)

## 2.0.0-rc.5

### Patch Changes

- 5f30a3b: Add browser prefetch utilities for faster consent banner visibility

  - New `buildPrefetchScript()` and `getPrefetchedInitialData()` in `c15t` core to start the `/init` request before framework hydration
  - New `C15tPrefetch` component in `@c15t/nextjs` using `next/script` with `beforeInteractive` strategy for static-route-compatible prefetching
  - Tuned default motion tokens (fast: 80ms, normal: 150ms, slow: 200ms) and replaced hardcoded CSS durations with theme variables

- 58fb392: Rename translation-facing APIs from `translations` to `i18n` across runtime types and helpers.
  Add CLI migration codemods to update existing projects to the new naming.
- e79f840: Separate published declaration files from runtime bundles to improve Vite compatibility

  - Move generated `.d.ts` files out of `dist/` into `dist-types/` across published packages
  - Stop emitting declaration maps in shared TypeScript config so `.d.ts.map` files are no longer published
  - Emit declarations only once per package to avoid unstable output when both `esm` and `cjs` builds write types
  - Update package `types` metadata, publish file lists, Turbo outputs, and publish artifact checks for the new layout
  - Verify the package layout works in Vite 7 without `optimizeDeps.exclude` workarounds for `c15t` and `@c15t/react`
