# @c15t/backend

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Restore `enabled: false` so all client-side consents are granted, initialization requests are skipped, and consent-gated scripts load immediately.

  Fix `www` handling in CORS origin matching. `*.example.com` now accepts `https://www.example.com`, and a schemeless `www.example.com` entry accepts both the apex and `www` forms.

  Support native WebView app schemes in `trustedOrigins` (`capacitor://localhost`, `ionic://localhost`, custom `iosScheme` values), matched on both scheme and host.

  Declare `hono` as `^4.12.34` rather than an exact pin so you can take Hono security releases without waiting for a new `@c15t/backend`.

## 2.2.0-canary-20260727202135

### Patch Changes

- 8c004cf: Improve generated OpenAPI request schemas for consent, subject, and legal-document endpoints.
- 16a1f82: Dependency audit for the next release: remove unused `@orpc/*` dependencies from `@c15t/backend` and `@c15t/node-sdk`, update runtime dependencies (hono 4.12.27, valibot 1.4.2, defu 6.1.7, jose 6.2.3, zod 4.4.3, zustand 5.0.14, xstate 5.32.4, and more), and force security floors for kysely (SQL injection fixes) and protobufjs via workspace overrides. Builds now use TypeScript 7 (native compiler) with rslib 0.23 for type checking and declaration emit; emitted types are semantically unchanged.
- c7e53ff: Forward `x-c15t-version` on backend-bound requests from browser, SSR, prefetch, and Node SDK clients, and allow the header through backend CORS preflight handling.
- e011d19: # Honor explicit ports in trusted origins

  Preserve explicit ports configured in `trustedOrigins` during CORS origin checks instead of stripping them. Host-only entries (e.g. `example.com`) remain port-agnostic, but entries with an explicit port (e.g. `localhost:3000`) now only trust that exact port.

- 5406a8d: Match legal-document policy types (`privacy_policy`, `dpa`, `terms_and_conditions`) by prefix so suffixed variants like `terms_and_conditions_b2b` are accepted, letting multiple policies of one family be active at once. Unknown types are still rejected.
- ca7784f: Prevent duplicate consent records from concurrent identical submissions. Concurrent in-flight client saves with the same intent are coalesced, and backend submissions derive the consent primary key from tenant, subject, domain, policy, and `givenAt`, so identical requests collide on the key every deployed database already enforces. Scope legacy duplicate lookups to the current tenant, and reject timestamps outside JavaScript's representable `Date` range before deriving the ID.
- dfec101: # Support drizzle-orm 0.45.x

  Bump `fumadb` from 0.2.2 to 0.3.0, which widens its optional peer dependency ranges to `drizzle-orm@^0.44.0 || ^0.45.0`, `prisma@6.x.x || 7.x.x`, and `mongodb@6.x.x || 7.x.x`. This fixes the unmet peer dependency error when installing `@c15t/backend` alongside drizzle-orm 0.45.x.

- 30cb116: Clamp client consent `givenAt` timestamps more than five minutes ahead of the server clock to server time before deriving consent validity. Preserve the client's original claim as `metadata.clientGivenAt` and use that claim for consent identity so retries remain idempotent. Sync local consent state to the timestamp recorded by the server. Leave timestamps within the five-minute tolerance and past timestamps unchanged.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a89092: Expanded the script loader with a registry-backed provider system and a much
  broader set of consent-aware integrations. New helpers cover analytics,
  advertising pixels, functional tools, and tag managers, including Ahrefs,
  Cloudflare Web Analytics, Fathom, Hotjar, Matomo, Microsoft Clarity, Mixpanel,
  Plausible, PromptWatch, Rybbit, Segment, Umami, Vercel Analytics, Reddit Pixel,
  Snapchat Pixel, and Crisp/Intercom.

  Provider manifests now share common utilities for script URL resolution, boolean
  data attributes, install-step builders, Google consent mapping, and lifecycle
  execution. The package also includes registry metadata, focused provider tests,
  and engine coverage so script helpers resolve predictable loader URLs,
  attributes, consent callbacks, and queued vendor calls.

  Google Tag and Google Tag Manager boot timestamps now resolve during script
  lifecycle execution instead of helper construction, which keeps documented setup
  patterns compatible with Next.js Cache Components prerendering.

  PostHog now supports explicit EU/US region selection, keeps the bootstrap script
  host aligned with an explicit API host, and exposes loading modes for immediate
  cookieless consent sync, consent-gated loading, or disabling the helper without
  issuing a PostHog network request.

  Updated the docs and CLI generation prompts so these providers are discoverable
  from the integration docs and script-loader setup flows.

## 2.0.0-rc.10

### Patch Changes

- 9579b62: Add token-first legal-document consent groundwork for `2.0`.

  - `c15t`: expand the unstable policy-consent input types so legal-document writes can prefer `documentSnapshotToken`, fall back to `policyHash`, and keep `policyId` only as a compatibility path.
  - `@c15t/backend`: update legal-document consent writes to resolve append-only consent against a verified document snapshot token when configured, or against a provided document hash when only lighter-weight release proof is available.
  - `@c15t/schema`: extend the subject consent schema and error shapes for legal-document snapshot tokens and hash-based legal-document resolution.

- Updated dependencies [9579b62]
  - @c15t/schema@2.0.0-rc.6

## 2.0.0-rc.8

### Patch Changes

- 3d5b0fd: Add legal-document snapshot support, persist document hashes on consent policies, and expose subject consent policy version/hash/effective-date metadata.
- 918a70e: Fix published TypeScript declaration packaging so consumers stay compatible across both TypeScript 5 and TypeScript 6.

  - `@c15t/react`: correct the `./primitives` type export entries so they point at the published `dist-types` files instead of missing declaration paths.
  - `@c15t/backend`, `@c15t/cli`, `@c15t/dev-tools`, `@c15t/logger`, `@c15t/node-sdk`, and `@c15t/scripts`: normalize emitted `dist-types` imports during builds so published declarations no longer reference sibling `.d.ts` files directly, which could break consumers on newer TypeScript versions.
  - Tooling: make declaration normalization discover package targets dynamically so the compatibility fix applies consistently across published packages instead of only a hardcoded subset.

- ad019de: Mark the edge runtime callables as unstable in `2.0`.

  - rename `c15tEdgeInit()` to `unstable_c15tEdgeInit()`
  - rename `resolveConsent()` to `unstable_resolveConsent()`
  - update the edge docs and source examples to use the `unstable_` exports

## 2.0.0-rc.6

### Patch Changes

- bb3ab0f: chore: update dependencies, including zustand and typescript
- 1a724fc: fix(policy-packs): support multiple primary actions while keeping customize as the default primary action

  Expose `primaryActions` consistently across schema, backend, core, React, and dev-tools. Built-in preset and offline default policies keep `customize` as the default primary action, while custom policies can now mark multiple actions as primary.

- Updated dependencies [1a724fc]
  - @c15t/schema@2.0.0-rc.4

## 2.0.0-rc.5

### Minor Changes

- 372cf92: feat(policy): add policy packs for declarative regional consent resolution

  Policy packs let you define regional consent rules once — c15t resolves the right policy automatically based on visitor location. Resolution follows fixed priority: region → country → fallback → default.

  - Built-in presets: `europeOptIn()`, `europeIab()`, `californiaOptOut()`, `californiaOptIn()`, `quebecOptIn()`, `worldNoBanner()`
  - Per-policy GPC support via `consent.gpc` field
  - Fallback policies (`match.fallback`) as a safety net when geo-location headers are missing
  - Material policy fingerprints for automatic re-prompting when consent semantics change
  - Policy validation with `inspectPolicies()` for catching misconfigurations before deployment
  - Snapshot tokens (signed JWT) for write-time consistency between `/init` and consent writes
  - Dev-tools match trace panel showing full resolution path

### Patch Changes

- 021ac99: Bundle version-matched docs inside published c15t packages under `docs/**` for local agent and developer reference.

  Remove CLI `AGENTS.md` generation. Use the bundled package docs directly alongside c15t agent skills.

- cfe1b2e: feat: Add edge-compatible `/init` handler for running consent policy resolution at the edge

  - `c15tEdgeInit()` — drop-in `/init` replacement for Vercel Middleware, Cloudflare Workers, and Deno Deploy
  - `resolveConsent()` — lightweight synchronous resolver for custom consent cookie flows
  - `resolvePolicySync()` — synchronous policy matching without fingerprint computation
  - Refactored `/init` route to use shared `resolveInitPayload` (no behavior change)

- e79f840: Separate published declaration files from runtime bundles to improve Vite compatibility

  - Move generated `.d.ts` files out of `dist/` into `dist-types/` across published packages
  - Stop emitting declaration maps in shared TypeScript config so `.d.ts.map` files are no longer published
  - Emit declarations only once per package to avoid unstable output when both `esm` and `cjs` builds write types
  - Update package `types` metadata, publish file lists, Turbo outputs, and publish artifact checks for the new layout
  - Verify the package layout works in Vite 7 without `optimizeDeps.exclude` workarounds for `c15t` and `@c15t/react`
